# Instructions
instructionList:
  - step: Preheat oven to 325F
  - step: Prepare ingredients — chop onions, jalapeño, garlic and one bell pepper. Drain Rotel and measure out enough quinoa to yield 2 cups - about 1/2 to 3/4 cup dry -  (this can also be replaced with rice or breadcrumbs)
  - step: Cut peppers length-wise (without removing stem - helps keep structural integrity) Remove extra rind and seeds from inside. Lightly coat each pepper (both sides) with olive / cooking oil. Set aside in lined baking sheet.
  - step: In large skillet, heat choice of cooking oil over medium heat. Cook onions, jalapeño, drained Rotel and bell pepper until sweated (6-10min).
  - step: While sweating ingredients, in a separate pot, begin boiling water and start preparing quinoa.
  - step: After sweating ingredients add turkey, garlic and all remaining seasoning. Mix together and cook until meat is browned. Transfer to a bowl while also straining out unnecessary fat.  Taste for salt / seasoning.
  - step: In bowl combine cooked quinoa with the cooked turkey mix and 1-1.5 cups of shredded cheese.
  - step: Stuff each half-pepper full. Garnish each evenly with remaining cheese and a pinch of paprika
  - step: Bake 15-20min until cheese begins to melt / peppers become soft and fully cooked through. Finish on broil for 3-5min or until cheese becomes golden / begins to brown.
